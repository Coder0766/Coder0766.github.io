The  Command-Line Interface can be very intimidating. It's an environment filled with codes, commands, paths, and symbols.  Once I began to experiment,  I soon realized that working with the command line over a graphical interface is faster and more efficient.




Today I will be showing you how I created a file using GNU nano. Nano is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems. One of the easier text-editors to use, I was able to add my first file and insert text without much fuss.  The commands are at the bottom, so it's easy to navigate through.



	
First, open your terminal and type nano. Notice the commands at the bottom of the window.

Help:  Press Ctrl+G to display a complete list of commands and associated hotkeys.

Exit: Close the program. You'll be prompted to save the current buffer or to exit without saving.

Write Out: Save the current buffer to the filesystem.

Read File: Open a file from the filesystem.

Where Is: Search for a text string.

Replace: Replace one text string for another.

Cut Text: Remove the current line of text.

Paste Text: Paste text from memory.

To Spell: Spell-check the current buffer.

Cur Pos: Display the position of the cursor relative to the contents of the buffer as a whole.

Go To Line: Move the cursor to a specific line number.







After nano is open, simply type in text in the space provided. You can even copy and paste!

To save your work, select Ctrl + O, write out the name of the file and hit enter
Close by typing Ctrl +X and type Y to save. 



Congratulations!!! You have just created your first file in nano!!!!
